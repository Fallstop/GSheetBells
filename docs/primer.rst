A Primer

:Feel free to skip:

GSheetBells concept is using the power and hosting of google sheets, to power a bell system that is easy to use, reliable and perfectly on time.

To build, it requires medium to high levels of technical knowledgeable - as this documentation is most defiantly not perfect. You will need to estimate some things. If you get stuck, please contact me, the Creator, at `jasper@qrl.nz <mailto::jasper@qrl.nz>`_. You can also make Pull Requests and raise issiues with the code and documentation at the Github Repository `here <https://github.com/Fallstop/GSheetBells>`_.

Rough Materials:
 - Access to 3D printer
 - Raspberry Pi (Types discussed in the next section )
 - Momentary switch, normal switch
 - led's red + green + resistors
 - Relay suited for your existing Bell System
