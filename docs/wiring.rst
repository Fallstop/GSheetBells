Wiring the components
=====================

This is one of the more complicated parts of tutorial, but it should be pretty easy once you get a grip on how it works.

Almost all of these stages are optional as you may not want to implement all of the features.

Default features that you can change:
 - Status LED's for internet (1 green, 1 red) and power (1 red LED).
 - Relay that protects the Raspberry Pi from the power of the existing setup and triggers the bells. This could in theory be simply replaced for a tone generator if your existing setup relies on that.
 - Mute bell switch, a switch that mutes the automatic ringing.
 - Ring now bell switch, a switch that bypasses the relay and forces the bells to ring.
