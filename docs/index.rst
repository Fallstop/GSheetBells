GSheetBells documentation
=======================================

Outline
-------

GSheetBells concept is using the power and hosting of google sheets, to power a bell system that is easy to configure, reliable and perfectly on time, every time.

To build, it requires medium to high levels of technical knowledgeable - as this documentation is most defiantly not perfect. You will need to estimate some things. 

If you get stuck, you can contact me, the Creator, at `jasper@qrl.nz <mailto::jasper@qrl.nz>`_. You can also make Pull Requests and raise issues with the code and documentation at the Github Repository `here <https://github.com/Fallstop/GSheetBells>`_.

Rough Materials:
 - Access to 3D printer
 - Raspberry Pi (Types discussed in the next section )
 - Momentary switch, normal switch
 - led's red + green + suitable resistors
 - Relay suited for your existing Bell System (Or tone generator if you have to, but it is not officially supported)
 - USB power for the Raspberry Pi + Ethernet cable
