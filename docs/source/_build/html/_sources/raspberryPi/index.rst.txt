The Raspberry pi
================

This is really up to you on which one you use, you can just use any slow ones sitting around, although make sure it *dose* have an ethernet port (You can use wifi, itâ€™s just more prone to password changes etc). I used an old raspberry pi 2 in my case.
You also need the SD card to hold the code and operating system.
